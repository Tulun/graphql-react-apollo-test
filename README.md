# Experiment building w/ GraphQL & React-Apollo

## Gist of project

I am going to experiment building a basic GraphQL project on my own with a basic server setup to see the challenges w/ both GraphQL and React, and how the latest version of React-Apollo works.

## Running the apps

There are 3 services to run: The frontend, created with create-react-app, the backend, created in express, and the database, using json server.

Make sure your node packages are installed in both the frontend and backend, as these are functionally separate applications

do the following:

- npm start (starts backend)
- npm run json:server (starts your database)
- cd fe && npm start (starts frontend)
